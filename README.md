# jsoncut-examples

This repository houses an ongoing collection of examples using the excellent [jsoncut] (https://github.com/json-transformations/jsoncut) package created by [Brian Peterson] (https://github.com/bpeterso2000) and co-maintained by [AJ Kerrigan] (https://github.com/ajkerrigan) and [Tim Phillips](https://github.com/trp07).

These examples are designed to demonstrate the flexibility and speed of `jsoncut` when doing ETL with large and/or deeply nested JSON objects; often originating from API responses.
